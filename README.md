# Distance Sharp IR Sensor

#### Project Overview

The Distance Sharp IR Sensor project demonstrates how to use an Arduino Mega with a Sharp IR distance sensor to measure distance accurately. This sensor provides analog voltage output corresponding to the distance of an object from the sensor. This project will show you how to read the analog output from the IR sensor, convert it into distance in centimeters, and display the distance readings on the Serial Monitor of Arduino IDE.

#### Components Needed

1. **Arduino Mega**
2. **Sharp IR Distance Sensor**
3. **Jumper Wires**

#### Block Diagram


#### Circuit Setup

1. **Connect the Sharp IR Sensor to Arduino Mega:**
   - **Signal (Analog Output)** to **Analog Pin A0**
   - **VCC** to **5V**
   - **GND** to **GND**

#### Instructions

1. **Install Required Libraries:**
   - No additional libraries are required for this project.

2. **Circuit Setup:**
   - Connect the Sharp IR sensor module to the Arduino Mega as specified in the circuit setup section.

3. **Code Upload:**
   - Open Arduino IDE and create a new sketch.
   - Copy and paste the provided Arduino code into the sketch.

4. **Testing:**
   - Upload the code to the Arduino Mega.
   - Open the serial monitor in Arduino IDE to view distance readings in centimeters.

#### Applications

- **Obstacle Avoidance:** Implement in robots or vehicles to avoid collisions.
- **Proximity Sensing:** Detect nearby objects for automated systems.
- **Industrial Automation:** Measure distances for control and monitoring purposes.
- **IoT Devices:** Integrate with IoT projects for distance-based applications.

#### Notes

- Ensure the IR sensor is positioned and calibrated according to the required distance range.
- Adjust the calculation formula if using a different model or type of IR distance sensor.
- Maintain stable power supply and connections for accurate distance measurements.
